I serve as a biostatistician with dual affiliations: one at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and the other at the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital/Harvard Medical School in Boston, USA. My academic pursuits center on methodological advancements in risk prediction, addressing statistical challenges in metabolomics and other biomarker research, and analyzing Electronic Health Records data. Clinically, I delve into the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of cardiovascular diseases.
