I serve as a biostatistician with dual affiliations. I have a permanent position as a Senior Scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and a tenure-track appointment as an Assistant Professor at the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital/Harvard Medical School in Boston, USA. This combination allows me to foster collaborations between my Boston-based colleagues who are renown experts in clinical cardiovascular research with my collaborators from Zurich who are part of one of the world's top-ten computer science department. My academic pursuits center around several key areas: advancing statistical methodologies for risk prediction, tackling statistical complexities in biomarker discovery studies encompassing metabolomics and other large omics datasets, and training diagnostic models using medical imaging and Electronic Health Records data. Clinical focus of my research centers on understanding the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of cardiovascular diseases.
